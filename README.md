# Online-Retail-Data-Analysis
This repository contains a Power BI report designed to provide insights and analysis for a retail store, focusing on revenue, customer, and demand analysis. This report was created as part of a Data Visualization Job Simulation by TATA, where I was tasked with developing a data-driven report for a retail company to help executives make informed decisions about revenue trends, customer insights, and regional demand. The report supports strategic decision-making for the CEO and CMO of the retail company.
